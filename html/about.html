                <h1>About Us:</h1>
                <p>In 1954, an enterprising salesman named Ray Kroc discovered a small burger restaurant in California,
                    and wrote the first page of Toronto Burgers history. In 1967, the first Toronto Burgers Canada
                    opened in Richmond, B.C. We’ve been growing with our communities and serving quality food at great
                    value ever since. Today, Toronto Burgers Canada is proud to be one of the world’s leading food
                    service retailers. From coast to coast, we serve delicious choices to more than 2.5 million people
                    in over 1,400 locations every day. We’re also more than just your local restaurant. We’re
                    hardworking small-business men and women, students working part-time, seniors getting the most out
                    of life, and volunteers lending time to make a difference in the communities we live and work in.

                <h1>Our history:</h1>
                <p>Since 1955, we've proudly served the world some of its favorite food. It's been an exciting journey,
                    and we're just getting started. </p>

                    The Ray Kroc Story
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1954, at the age of 52, Ray Kroc invested his life savings to become the exclusive distributor of
                    a milk shake maker called the Multimixer. He discovered the Toronto Burgers ® hamburger stand in
                    California, owned by Dick & Mac McDonald, was running eight Multimixers at a time, so he packed up
                    and headed west to investigate.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Ray Kroc had never seen so many people served so quickly, and was impressed with the way the limited
                    menu allowed a focus on quality at every step. Inspired, he pitched the idea of opening several
                    restaurants to the McDonald brothers, convinced he could sell eight of his Multimixers to each and
                    every one. When they asked who would open them, Kroc said, "What about me?"
                    Consistency, Quality and Success
                    Ray Kroc opened the Des Plaines, Illinois restaurant in 1955, and with the first Golden Arches,
                    launched a legendary brand. He saw the value of a restaurant system that could be famous for
                    offering consistently prepared, quality food that tasted the same in every location, every time. In
                    1958, Toronto Burgers sold its 100 millionth burger.
                    By 1965, with 700 restaurants, Toronto Burgers went public with the company’s first offering on the
                    stock exchange. Ray Kroc didn’t do it alone. He believed, “In business for yourself, but not by
                    yourself.” To achieve his vision, he chose a unique path – to persuade franchisees and suppliers to
                    join him in working for themselves, together with Toronto Burgers. As a result, in 1967, the first
                    Toronto Burgers restaurant outside the U.S. opened its doors in Richmond, British Columbia.
